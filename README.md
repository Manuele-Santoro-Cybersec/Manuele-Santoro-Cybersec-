# Hi, I'm Manuele! 👋

## 📸 From Visual Precision to Cyber Defense
I am a **Senior Professional** currently pivoting from high-end digital photography (Real Estate sector, UK) to **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**. My background in professional photography has developed my relentless attention to detail and ability to handle complex digital assets—skills I now leverage for threat detection and log analysis.

### 🛡️ Cybersecurity Expertise
I am actively building my expertise in Blue Team operations, currently focused on the **HTB Junior Analyst Path**.

* **Sherlock Investigations:** Hands-on experience in analyzing APT scenarios (Lazarus, RomCom).
* **Digital Forensics:** Proficient in Windows artifact analysis ($MFT, Registry, LNK files, USNJournal).
* **Hybrid Workflow:** I utilize **Linux environments** (Bash, grep, awk) for high-speed data processing and incident correlation.

### 💻 Software Development & Automation
I believe in understanding the "how" behind the tools.
* **C# Development:** Currently mastering C# (via The C# Player's Guide) to understand Windows internals and automate security tasks.
* **Automation:** Building custom scripts to streamline forensic artifact extraction.
